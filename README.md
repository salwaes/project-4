As a user, I want to be able to create an account to log in my own page and get the news with a scale set by my session's activities

As a user, I want to have news for a specific key word or field

As a user, I need to be able to mark each article as dope or blah
  If I note a positive article as dope the balance leans more to the happy side and the oposite for the negative ones
  If I note it as blah it reduce the positive or negative feed by 1Ns unit
  
As a user, I also want to get the twitter feed depending on the set scale
  
As a user, I can see a graph of my news scale's changement over time.
